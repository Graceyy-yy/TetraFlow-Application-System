# TetraFlow-Application-System
Overview
This repository contains the code for the TetraFlow Application System, designed to handle the application process for a specific course or program. The system allows users to apply through a web form, and administrators can monitor applications through a dashboard. The backend handles the logic of checking applicants' eligibility and available space in the program and sends automated emails based on the outcome.
